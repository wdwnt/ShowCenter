Note: This *needs* Prize Wall to exist in order to function.

Game states:
* Intro

* Chaser reveal
 - just some sound and a camera view

* Cash Builder
 - Host asks questions, contestant gives answers orally, each right answer has points go up
 - <DURATION> timer on screen
 - Right answers give the player <AMOUNT> points
 - Wrong/pass is no harm, but time delay while we give the right answer

* Head-to-Head
 - Point selection
  * Initially display points from cash builder in middle step
  * Let chaser set point totals for step closer and step further
   - BALLPARK: Double it if they make it harder, half it if they make it easier
  * Step positions:
   - Easy: 4 from top, 4 questions to win
   - Normal: 3 from top, 5 questions to win
   - Hard: 2 from top, 6 questions to win
  * Contestant chooses where to start - other points disappear, that one is now their player marker
  * Chaser starts at top of the board
 - Actual chase
  * Question shows up on screen
  * Host reads
  * When host done reading, 3 answer choices show up
  * As soon as answers display, buzzers are unlocked
  * As soon as one player locks an answer, other has 5s to lock theirs
  * Once both are locked, host reveals player answer, then correct answer, then chaser answer
   - If player correct, they move step closer to home
   - If chaser correct, they move step closer to player
  * Repeat until caught or home free
   - If caught, out of the game
   - If home, bank points for Final Chase

* Final Chase
 - Players get X steps ahead, where X is remaining players
  * IF THERE ARE NO PEOPLE: Team picks one person to play for <MINIMUM_PRIZE_VALUE> for each player
 - Players get 2 minutes to answer as many questions as they can (same style as cash builder)
  * If there's only one player, player just states the answer when they know it
  * If not, players buzz in and answer when called on
   - add <BUZZ_IN_LATENCY> to timer when someone buzzes in to deal with latency
 - Each question right puts them another step further from the chaser
 - Chaser then has 2 minutes to answer questions
  * Each question right gets them a step closer to the players
  * If they get a question wrong, clock stops, players get a chance to steal; if they get it right, chaser gets pushed back
 - If chaser catches in 2min, players lose; if not, players win, split bank evenly among all of them

* Ending
